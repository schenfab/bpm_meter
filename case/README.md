# Case

The case has been designed on tinkercad and consists of two parts:

- [Main part](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/alizliCqtUU-bpm-meter-haupt)
- [Back panel](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/k8QlQjkNnKJ-bpm-meter-rueck)

The two parts can be assembled together using M2.5 machine screws of 10mm length.
